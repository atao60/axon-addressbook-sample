Welcome to the main page of the Axon Address Book Sample.
=====

Goal
----

This is an updated version of [AxonFramework - Addressbook-Sample](https://github.com/AxonFramework/Addressbook-Sample).


This sample will show the basic features of the Axon framework. It will be done using multiple different client side applications, i.e.:

* a flex client, 
* a spring mvc client, 
* a REST client 
* and the start of a Vaadin client. 

The REST client is used in a node.js sample that can be found in another repository, [jettro - axon-addressbook-nodejs](https://github.com/jettro/axon-addressbook-nodejs).
